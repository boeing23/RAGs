This course will cover supervised learning, pattern
classification, neural networks, support vector machine,
unsupervised learning, cluster analysis, feature discovery,
cross-validation, principal component analysis, independent
component analysis, and matrix factorization with an
emphasis on the strategic frontier between machine
learning and big-data sciences
The course is theoretical,
practical, and challenging in nature
Major effort will be
made to present applications in the areas of computer-
aided decision making, big data analytics, human genome
data, and biomedical imaging
